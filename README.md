# TeachEasy – Empowering Educators with Resources

## 📌 Problem Statement
Educators often have to pay out of their own pockets to support individual classes or classrooms.  
➡️ **97–99% of teachers** use personal funds for school-related purposes ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/de/news-release/2019/08/23/1906087/0/en/Survey-Reveals-99-of-Teachers-Use-Personal-Funds-for-School-Related-Purchases.html?utm_campaign=netcore-brand-terms&utm_content=undefined&utm_keyword=undefined%3Fwtime%3Fwtime%3Dseek_to_second_number%3Fwtime%3Dseek_to_second_number%3Fwtime&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=undefined&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
➡️ In **2024–25**, the average teacher spent **over $900** out-of-pocket for the year ([source](https://www.adoptaclassroom.org/2025/06/09/2025-teacher-survey-spending-stats-classroom-needs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

Unfortunately:  
- Many teachers are **not aware** of grant or scholarship options.  
- The process to find opportunities is **manual, tedious, and time-consuming**.  
- Educators must **search across multiple platforms** and apply individually, taking valuable time away from their students.
