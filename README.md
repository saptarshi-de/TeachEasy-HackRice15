# TeachEasy – Empowering Educators with Resources

## 📌 Problem Statement
Educators often have to pay out of their own pockets to support individual classes or classrooms.  
➡️ **97–99% of teachers** use personal funds for school-related purposes ([source](link-here)).  
➡️ In **2024–25**, the average teacher spent **over $900** out-of-pocket for the year ([source](link-here)).  

Unfortunately:  
- Many teachers are **not aware** of grant or scholarship options.  
- The process to find opportunities is **manual, tedious, and time-consuming**.  
- Educators must **search across multiple platforms** and apply individually, taking valuable time away from their students.
